# Risk-graded approval

[Back to the manual](../en.md) · [Português (Brasil)](../pt-BR/risk-graded-approval.md)

Every permission request carries a **risk seal**, set by a fixed rule list in the daemon (no AI):
**Low risk** (reads inside the project), **Medium risk** (most commands, writes inside the project,
anything that reaches the network, unknown tools and MCP) and **High risk** (for example `rm -rf`,
`git push --force`, `sudo`, command substitution, a pipe into a shell, or any access to credential
paths). You can add patterns in the host configuration (`risk.extraHigh`); the built-in ones cannot
be lowered.

- A **High risk** request is red and **Approve** becomes **Hold to approve**: hold the button for 2
  seconds. The reason is written under the button (not only in a tooltip). The A key does not
  approve it; N still denies. The host checks the hold too: it refuses
  an approval of a high-risk request that does not carry it ("A high-risk request is approved only
  by holding the button."), so no other client can skip it either.
- The tray never approves a high-risk request: it offers **Deny** and **Open**.
- With automatic approval on, an approval that nobody gave by hand shows in the session's
  timeline as "Approved automatically", with who decided and why. A high-risk request or one that
  reaches the network always comes to you.
- On a host whose daemon has automatic approval, the host page has an **Automatic approvals**
  button. The screen lists what the daemon decided, newest first: the tool, the risk, whether it
  **Approved** or **Asked you**, who decided (the rule or the AI and its model) and why. Filter by
  project, or by tool or reason in **Filter decisions**. **Suspended sessions** lists the sessions
  where automatic approval stopped because third-party content arrived, with the reason; **Resume**
  asks for confirmation before turning it back on.
- The tray tooltip adds how many automatic approvals the app has seen.
